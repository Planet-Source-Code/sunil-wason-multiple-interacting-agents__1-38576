## Multiple Interacting Agents


</div>

### Description

This application shows how we can make use of multiple agents interact with each other simultaneously. This code can have numerous end uses especially in the field of presentations & advertisements where issues can be focussed and delivered through animated characters to the public.

Although I have designed the entire code by myself however, I have taken help from various MS Agent codes available on the PSC and fianally come out with this one since, I could not find any code which so explicitly displayed the use of multiple agents.

Please read the accompanied Readme First.txt file before using this application.

Please vote.
