This application shows how we can make use of multiple agents interact with each other simultaneously. This code can have numerous end uses especially in the field of presentations & advertisements where issues can be focussed and delivered through animated characters to the public.
Although I have designed the entire code by myself however, I donot take full credit to the same since I have taken help from various MS Agent codes available on the PSC and fianally come out with this one since, I could not get any one which so explicitly displayed the use of multiple agents.

If your application doesnot work go to
Project --> References and check
Microsoft Agent Control 2.0.

You are required to install Microsoft Agent 2.0 which can be downloaded from the Microsoft site (http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/imedia/agent) before using this program.
